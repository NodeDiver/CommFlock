# Critical Fixes Applied - 2025-10-06

## Summary
Fixed 4 critical inconsistencies introduced by password authentication feature

---

## ✅ Fix #1: Seed Script Now Creates Valid Users

**Issue:** Demo user created without password, couldn't sign in
**File:** `prisma/seed.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `bcrypt` import
- Hash demo password before creating user
- Added `hashedPassword` field to user creation
- Console logs demo credentials for developers

**Testing:**
```bash
npm run db:reset
npm run seed
# Try signing in with: username=demo, password=demo1234
```

---

## ✅ Fix #2: Backwards Compatibility for Legacy Users

**Issue:** Existing users without passwords locked out
**File:** `src/lib/auth.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added backwards compatibility check
- Legacy users (no `hashedPassword`) can still sign in
- Logs warning when legacy user signs in
- Added TODO comment for future password setup prompt

**Impact:**
- ✅ Existing users can still access their accounts
- ✅ No data migration required immediately
- ⚠️ Future improvement: Prompt legacy users to set password

---

## ✅ Fix #3: Locale Redirect After Sign-In

**Issue:** Sign-in redirect missing locale, caused extra redirect
**File:** `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Changed `router.push('/discover')` → `router.push(\`/${locale}/discover\`)`
- Now includes locale in redirect URL
- Prevents middleware from doing additional redirect

**Impact:**
- ✅ Smoother navigation after sign-in
- ✅ Maintains user's language preference

---

## ✅ Fix #4: Removed Password Logging

**Issue:** Passwords logged in console (security vulnerability)
**File:** `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Removed `console.log('Signup request body:', body)`
- Added safe logging that excludes password
- Logs only non-sensitive metadata

**Security Impact:**
- ✅ Passwords no longer in server logs
- ✅ Reduced attack surface
- ✅ Compliance with security best practices

---

## ✅ Fix #5: Error Message Security

**Issue:** Internal error details exposed to client
**File:** `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Removed `details: error.message` from response
- Generic error message for client
- Full error still logged server-side

**Security Impact:**
- ✅ Internal system details not exposed
- ✅ Prevents information disclosure attacks
- ✅ Better error handling

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Tests:
- [x] Seed script runs without errors
- [x] Demo user has password set
- [x] Sign-in page includes locale in redirect
- [x] Passwords not in console logs
- [x] Error messages don't expose internals

### 🔄 Recommended Additional Tests:
- [ ] Fresh install: Reset DB → Seed → Sign in as demo
- [ ] Legacy user test: Create user without password → Try sign in
- [ ] Invalid password: Wrong password shows error
- [ ] Sign-in → Discover: Verify redirect preserves locale
- [ ] Network error: Signup fails gracefully

## ⚠️ Known Remaining Issues

See `CONSISTENCY_AUDIT.md` for full list. Priority items:

1. **No Password Reset Flow** (High Priority)
   - Users who forget password are locked out
   - Need email sending + reset token system

2. **No Rate Limiting** (Medium Priority)
   - Auth endpoints vulnerable to brute force
   - Recommend: `@upstash/ratelimit` or similar

3. **README Not Updated** (Low Priority)
   - Still mentions "no passwords in v1"
   - Needs section on password requirements
