# CommFlock - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for CommFlock.

## Immediate Fixes

- [ ] Restore the required `<html>`/`<body>` structure in `src/app/layout.tsx` so Next.js can render the tree without hitting the “Root layout must return html/body tags” runtime error.
- [ ] Correct the translation loader import in `src/lib/i18n.ts` (point it at `src/messages`) to eliminate the `Failed to load Intl messages` exception on every request.
- [ ] Make every navigation path locale-aware: update `router.push`/`Link` calls in the auth, discover, create, and community pages plus `pages.signIn/pages.signUp` in `src/lib/auth.ts` so they reuse the active locale instead of 404ing on `/sign-in`.
- [ ] Convert `src/app/[locale]/(public)/page.tsx` to a client component (or refactor to a server-safe pattern) so that using `useTranslations`/`useLocale` doesn’t trigger the “Hooks can only be used in client components” build failure.
- [ ] Add the missing invariants in the API layer: confirm the community slug before registering for an event, run `joinCommunitySchema`/new Zod checks in the members endpoint, and replace the `any` payloads with typed objects.
- [ ] Align `createCommunitySchema` with `POST /api/communities` so the slug can be optional when the server generates it via `generateSlug`.
- [ ] Replace the hard-coded English UI strings in the sign-in/up, discover, community, and admin pages with `next-intl` keys to keep both locales in sync.
- [ ] Fill in or remove the admin quick links that point to non-existent routes (`/[slug]/admin/announcements`, `events`, `polls`) to prevent broken navigation.
