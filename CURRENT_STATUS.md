## 🟡 Known Issues & Remaining Work

### High Priority 🔴

1. **Community Page Performance**
   - LCP: 18.2 seconds (should be <2.5s)
   - CLS: 0.407 (should be <0.1)
   - **Impact:** Users see blank page for 18 seconds
   - **Priority:** HIGH - needs investigation and profiling

### Medium Priority 🟡

2. **Total Blocking Time (All Pages)**
   - Current: 2,500-2,720ms
   - Target: <300ms
   - **Solution:** Code splitting, lazy loading, defer non-critical JS

3. **3G Speed Index**
   - Landing page: 8.5s on 3G (should be <4s)
   - **Solution:** Progressive enhancement, loading states

### Remaining Tasks ⏳

4. **Week 3 Tasks (2 remaining)**
   - Test keyboard navigation on all pages
   - Add aria-labels and run axe audit

### Environment Variables Required

**Required for full functionality:**

```env
# Core (working)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...

# Phase 1-5 features (optional but recommended)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...              # Password reset emails
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://... # Rate limiting
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...       # Rate limiting
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://... # Error monitoring
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

✅ Phase 1-5 completed successfully in one go
✅ i18n working perfectly across entire site
✅ Load More pagination implemented correctly
✅ CI/CD pipeline working (auto-deploy on push to main)
✅ Git SSH authentication configured

### What Could Be Improved

⚠️ Need better error handling in some components
⚠️ Missing loading states in several places
⚠️ Test coverage should be higher
⚠️ Performance not yet measured
⚠️ Should add more code comments

### What to Watch Out For

🚨 Cursor AI can break things - always review changes
🚨 Server Components need locale parameter passed explicitly
🚨 API responses need consistent format (array vs object)
🚨 Rate limiting requires Redis in production
🚨 Email requires Resend API key
